# About

I'm a senior software engineer specialising in iOS development, with a passion for crafting seamless and innovative mobile experiences. Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with some of the industry's leading companies, including the BBC, Booking.com, SkyBet, and Auto Trader. These experiences have honed my skills and deepened my understanding of what it takes to deliver high-quality, user-centric software.

Beyond the realm of code, I'm an avid gamer, immersing myself in virtual worlds that challenge and entertain. Music is a constant companion in my life, with hip hop being my genre of choice, providing the perfect soundtrack to both work and play. When I'm not coding or gaming, I'm a dedicated family man, cherishing every moment spent with my wife and children.

This website is a space where I share my professional journey, insights from my projects, and snippets of my personal life. Whether you're here to explore my work, connect professionally, or just share in my interests, I'm glad you stopped by. Let's explore the intersection of technology, creativity, and family together.
