I'm new to all this blogging malarkey, I have been advised to do so by my friend and colleague [Andrew Beacock](http://blog.andrewbeacock.com/){:target="_blank"}. It appears I am worthy of sharing some of my knowledge of all things java and software development related to the world.

So lets start with a bit of geeky fun…

{% highlight java %}
public class FirstBlogPost {
    public FirstBlogPost() {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
class FirstBlogPost
  def initialize
    puts 'Hello World!'
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Maybe I should have named this post “Hello World in Java and Ruby” :o)

That's all for now, check back later for more in depth advice and discoveries.
